Drought analysis involves assessing and monitoring the impact of drought conditions on various environmental factors, including variables like precipitation ("pr") and transpiration ("pet"). It helps in understanding the severity, duration, and spatial distribution of drought events and their potential consequences. Here's how we can perform a basic drought analysis:

1) Drought Index Calculation:
Calculate a drought index based on the ratio of precipitation to transpiration. Common drought indices include the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) or the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). Choose an appropriate index for your analysis.

2) Threshold Definition:
Define drought thresholds for your chosen index. These thresholds categorize drought severity levels (e.g., mild, moderate, severe, extreme) based on the index values.

3) Drought Classification:
Classify each time period (e.g., month or year) based on the calculated drought index and thresholds. Identify periods of drought and their severity levels.


Forecasting involves predicting future values of a time series based on historical data. In our case, we can perform forecasting for both "pr" (precipitation) and "pet" (transpiration) data separately. Here, a basic example of how to perform time series forecasting using a simple method known as Exponential Smoothing. More advanced methods like ARIMA, Prophet, or machine learning models can also be applied for forecasting.
